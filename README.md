# Digit recognition deep learning AI

This is a personal project I undertook to make a deep learning AI that can recognise 28x28 images of numerical digits from the MNIST dataset. I didn't use any libraries for the neural net and coded it along with all of its arithmetic from scratch.

The AI automatically processes the inputs and outputs its answer along with diagnostic data to the console.

Work in progress, the neural net needs some tuning and debugging.
